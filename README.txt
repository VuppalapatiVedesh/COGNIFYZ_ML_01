Description:
This project aims to predict the aggregate rating of restaurants using
machine learning regression models. The dataset includes restaurant
details such as location, cost, services offered, and customer engagement.

Approach:
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding
- Trained Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression models
- Evaluated models using Mean Squared Error and R² Score
- Analyzed feature importance to identify key factors affecting ratings

Conclusion:
Decision Tree Regression achieved the best performance.
Feature importance analysis revealed that customer votes play
a significant role in determining restaurant ratings.
